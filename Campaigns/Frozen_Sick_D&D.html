    <p data-content-chunk-id="65cf8609-870e-4946-837e-dfaf2b471e6e">Urgon Wenth, a dwarf explorer, recently returned
      home to Palebank Village after exploring the icy wastes of Eiselcross for a year. The dwarf brought home several
      items plundered from ruins on Foren, the largest of Eiselcross’s islands. Among these treasures were two beautiful
      blue glass vials, which Urgon sold to an elf collector named Verla Pelc. The vials were then stolen, given to a
      fence out of Shadycreek Run, and sold again to an unsuspecting merchant.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="ca3aad21-eac3-40db-b73c-f434b73e74c1">In truth, the vials’ beautiful blue color is the
      result of deadly blue spores that cling to the interior of the glass. Faint cracks in both the vials have exposed
      each person who handled them to frigid woe, a deadly disease that can’t be cured by conventional means. The
      disease has already killed Urgon and Verla, turning them into ice statues. Details on frigid woe are found in the
      “<a title="Eiselcross" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/wildemount-gazetteer-eiselcross"

    <aside id="FrigidWoe" class="block-torn-paper">
      <p><strong>Frigid Woe</strong></p>
      <p>Frigid woe is a special disease developed by Aeor’s mages that cannot be cured by conventional treatment or
        magic. The only way a creature infected with the disease can be cured is by finding and drinking the
        manufactured antidote, a milky liquid stored in gold vials found in Eiselcross’s ruins. This disease was created
        to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the healing power of their clerics and angels.</p>
      <p>The disease is transmitted by breathing in blue spores that Aeor’s mages created long ago. When a creature
        comes into contact with these spores, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected
        with frigid woe. It takes 1d4 days for the symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. These symptoms include
        fatigue, chills, and visible blue veins that appear on the creature’s body. The infected creature’s speed is
        reduced by 5 feet as long as it remains infected. Every 10 days after symptoms appear, an infected creature must
        succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced by another 5 feet. If a creature’s speed
        is reduced to 0 as a result of this disease, the creature dies and its body turns into a statue made of ice.</p>
      <p>A creature can drink the antidote as an action, ending all symptoms and effects of the disease instantly.</p>

      Adventure Summary</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="0d115473-51e1-4caf-9ec4-16bbf3fbddf2">While the characters are in Palebank Village,
      community leader Elro Aldataur asks for their help figuring out who or what has killed Urgon Wenth. An explorer
      recently returned from Eiselcross, Urgon was afflicted by a strange malady that turned him into an ice statue, and
      which has since shown up in another of the village’s residents. The characters investigate the mystery while
      contending with the forces of the Uttolots, one of the criminal families that control Shadycreek Run. More
      infected locals are discovered, including one more already dead, before the characters clear Uttolot thugs out of
      a local cavern complex called Croaker Cave. In the end, the vials of frigid woe are reclaimed, but merchant Irven
      Liel and his family are infected and will be the next to die without a cure. Moreover, the characters might well
      be infected with the disease themselves.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="4c8a4027-8cf2-41a6-bba2-f0918ac1cd0b">Elro asks the characters to travel to Eiselcross to
      seek a cure for frigid woe. The characters take a boat to Syrinlya, the Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, and retrace
      Urgon Wenth’s path to the ruin of Salsvault. This magic laboratory was once a part of Aeor, an ancient flying
      city-state that crashed into Eiselcross during the Calamity. Only by braving Salsvault’s defenses and deadly
      guardians can the adventurers find the antidote they need.</p>

      characters drawn immediately into the drama of death in an isolated settlement. Once the players are ready to
      begin, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:</p>
    <aside class="read-aloud-text">
      <p>Snow gently falls from the sky and wind bites your cheeks as you stand in the graveyard of Palebank Village, a
        fishing outpost of Uthodurn that is home to several hundred dwarves and elves. The sun is low in the sky,
        sinking behind the fresh grave of Urgon Wenth, an old dwarf who caught a curse or disease that turned him into
        an ice statue. The folk of the village have gathered to pay their final respects to Urgon’s frozen remains.</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="c09049c3-5297-43c9-8325-514c818323c9">As part of their characters’ backstories, the
      players can decide whether any of them knew Urgon or whether they’ve come to the funeral simply to show respect to
      the folk of the community. Either way, continue by reading the following:</p>
    <aside class="read-aloud-text">
      <p>A gruff voice speaks softly from behind you. “Thank you for attending Urgon’s service.” You turn and meet the
        gaze of Elro Aldataur, a weathered elf, retired ranger, and the leader of the village. “I’m sorry to speak of
        dark tidings under such circumstances, but I believe that Palebank Village might be in danger, and I’m hoping
        you can help us.”</p>
    </aside>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="77cb2a10-acad-4f23-b786-5597c6dd72ec">Whether the characters are known in the village as

      hopes that they’re the sort of people not afraid to step up to help folks in need. Use the following points to
      help guide the conversation as he explains his concerns to the characters:</p>

      <li data-content-chunk-id="8ab6ecf9-027d-4554-b749-223d25910e93">Two months ago, Urgon Wenth returned home after
        exploring Eiselcross for a year. He had been back for only for a few days when he came down with a strange
        affliction, which made the dwarf move slowly and caused blue veins to appear all over his body.</li>
      <li data-content-chunk-id="bcf0ebde-4f64-4a2c-b323-c4b59fa54dc9">The village’s priests of Moradin and Corellon
        used every spell they could muster to attempt to heal Urgon, but nothing they tried could stop the bizarre
        malady. Urgon battled the affliction for weeks, until his ever-slowing body eventually turned to ice.</li>
      <li data-content-chunk-id="15c338ea-adc8-4142-a833-03a885589570">Until yesterday, Elro and the rest of the
        community believed that Urgon’s sad fate was an isolated incident, most likely caused by something the dwarf
        came into contact with while exploring Eiselcross. Then Elro noticed Tulgi Lutan, a dwarf trapper, showing signs
        of the same illness.</li>
      <li data-content-chunk-id="4dcabe7a-2cfd-47fd-8986-14614bcfdd98">Alarmed, Elro tried to talk to Tulgi about it,
        but she pushed him away, asking that he let her die in peace.</li>

      Request</h3>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="9c1a950f-fe7a-46d9-8a36-90015081f236">If the characters are willing, Elro wants them to
      find out what caused Urgon and Tulgi’s affliction. He’s worried that it could spread, but Tulgi refuses to talk to
      him, and the Glassblades in the village are better known for their combat skills than their ability to glean the
      truth in a complicated situation. Moreover, Tulgi is extremely distrustful of the authorities.</p>
    <p data-content-chunk-id="745f2838-6e71-4250-a322-1986595d953c">Elro thinks a group of adventurers might have better
      luck convincing Tulgi to talk. If the characters agree to help find the cause of Urgon and Tulgi’s affliction,
      Elro offers to pay them 100 gp. He suggests that the characters start by searching Urgon’s home or talking to
      Tulgi at her cabin.</p>
